# PrintNC Pro Solidworks

Building off of the [PrintNC Solidworks repo](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/PrintNC_Solidworks), This repo is my modified PrintNC with CNC machined components, servos, flood Cooling, Dual carriages on all axes etc..  

For simplicity for myself, I’ll be building parts that are not parametric and will be specific to the existing design of my machine. 

A Fusion 360 file generated from the STEP file can be found here:
