# PrintNC Pro Solidworks

Building off of the [PrintNC Solidworks repo](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/PrintNC_Solidworks), This repo is my modified PrintNC with CNC machined components, servos, flood Cooling, Dual carriages on all axes etc..  

For simplicity for myself, Iâ€™ll be building parts that are not parametric and will be specific to the existing design of my machine.
